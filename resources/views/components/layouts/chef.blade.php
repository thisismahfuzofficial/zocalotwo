                          Chef Basir brings his love for food, hospitality, and business to every meal. For as long as
                          he can remember, he has enjoyed giving people a unique and fun experience through food. After
                          many years of successful business ownership, he took his passion one step further when he
                          completed a degree in Culinary Arts from the world-renowned Art Institute. With the belief
                          that fine cuisine should be available and convenient for everyone, he founded Chef On Wheels
                          in 2012 and has been spreading deliciousness in the DC area through a snazzy red truck. In
                          November 2017 Chef Basir opened up the first Chef on Wheels restaurant in Reston, VA. Later
                          renamed it Taco Zocalo.
